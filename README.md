0x1D. C - Binary trees
CGroup projectAlgorithmData structure
Binary trees are implemented in C using a structure. The structure typically contains three fields:

    Data: This field stores the value of the node.
    Left: This field stores a pointer to the left child node, or NULL if the node has no left child.
    Right: This field stores a pointer to the right child node, or NULL if the node has no right child.
